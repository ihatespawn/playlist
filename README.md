# cobalt playlist downloader
a lot of people have been asking for this, so i made it. paste the link, download the first file, allow multiple file downloads if you didn't do that before and keep saving files until it finishes.

for now it only supports audio because it was made to download music, i think???

## supported services
- youtube

## api
if you want you can use the `/getvideos` endpoint.
example curl command:
```
curl https://playlist.spawn.best/getvideos?playlist=(playlist url)
```
example response:
```
